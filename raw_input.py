#Main goal of eh code is that it wont break more than anything else
#number1 = int(input("Enter a number: ")) #PYTHON 3 raw_input is changed to input ONLY accepts ints
#string1 = str(input("Enter a string: "))

#creating python program
#in root
#mkdir pythonprograms
#nano python1.py 
##!/usr/bin/python    <-- Where all libs are

number1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
result = number1 * number2
print ("The result is: %d" %result)

#now we must make it exec by giving ourselves permission
#chmod +x python1.py
